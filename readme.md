cd your-app-folder-from-git-clone
```
- Install php dependencies with (see [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) if you haven't install composer on your system) :
```
composer install
```
- Create your database (in this example i will create 'complaint_hub' database on mysql).
- Move to application root folder, open '.env.example' file on your favorite editor, and save it as '.env'
- Modify your '.env' file depending on your environment and database config. Sample of '.env' file :
```
